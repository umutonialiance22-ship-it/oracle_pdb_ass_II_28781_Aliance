creation of pluggable database in oracle
--Overview of tasks 
it was crazy to create since am not even familiar with the codes in the first place but also it was worth it since am now able to create 
pluggable database especially using oracle
--Oracle environment used
the environment was also kinda challenging but worth it
--Explanation of each task
first of all i created the pluggable database then displayed it, then i created another one to delete as instructed then after that 
i dropped it per instructed then i took screenshots then i accessed the OEM dashboard then took screenshots as a proof
--Challenges faced (if any) and how they were solved
too much error, unfamiliar codes, too much internet, complexities of coding especially creating the pdb such as the files locations and all ... it was alot 
--Integrity statement
but it was also a great experience since we need to push out of the confront zone sooo... we appreciate the whole challenges
